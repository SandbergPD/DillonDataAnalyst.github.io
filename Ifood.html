											<h2>Delivery Decoded:</h2>
											<p>Analyzing the Flavorful Data of Delivery Trends</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Just think, you're watching your favorite show or your favorite sports game, and you realize the food 
											you just got at the supermarket just isn't as appealing as it was when you got it. And why not get food 
											delivered? I can't be the only one that thinks like that! So I wanted to get an eye on some data and 
											see how many others might be like me. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Queue Ifood and the dataset that is present on GitHub. 
										</p>
										<p>
											<a href="https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test/blob/master/iFood%20Data%20Analyst%20Case.pdf">Ifood Dataset</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											Ifood is a company like Doordash that provides meal delivery services in Brazil. Gaining valuable insights 
											from data and understanding the spending habits and customer base. 
										</p>
										<p>
											<li>67% of the spending variance can be explained by income</li>
											<li>There are over 10,000 purchases made by the 60k-80k salary range category being the most prominent</li>
											<li>Spending on premium or gold-valued products is more common the lower a customers income</li>
										</p>
										<p>
											*Note this project is actually modified from an iFood job interview case study given by the Brazilian equivalent 
											of DoorDash, iFood. The data is 98% real, but slightly modified for educational purposes.

												<h3>Data-Driven Insights</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											Primarily using Microsoft Excel for most of the data analysis I started by looking at who joined and when. There is
											 a pretty even spread over the year of new customers joining the platform with an average of 186 new sign-ups monthly,
											  but peaking in January. That's a strange time for there to be new sign ups. I wish there was additional information
											   that we could look at to identify a deeper trend. Maybe some people saying "New Year, New Me" and trying to eat 
											   healthy and not knowing where to start. So an easy way to eat healthy is to buy healthy. Or possibly people got gift
											    cards during the holidays and they are finally using them. We'll never know!
										</p>
										</section>
										<section>
										<p>
											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/MonthJoinedBarChart1.png" alt="" /></a>
										</p>
										<p>
											Having looked at when people signed up, I decided I needed to look at the spending habits. Which lead me into seeing if
											 there was a correlation between income level and total amount spend through the service. And there was! A 67% relationship
											  between a person's salary and the amount that is spent with the service. 
										</p>
										</section>
										<p>
										</p>
										<p>
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/TotalSpentIncomeScatter.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												The more people make, the more they spend on the service, but to a point. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper and see
												 if there was something that was missing. Using SQL I was able to look at the data easier and make different income 
												 brackets for the customers.
											</p>
										</section>
											<p>
											</p>
											
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Income Brackets.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												One added benefit of separating the customers into income brackets, I was able to clearly show the sheer number of 
												purchases from the 60k-80k bracket.
											</p>
										</section>
											<p>
											</p>
											
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Avg Purchase Amount Income.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												Using Tableau you can clearly see that the more people make, the more they spend but until over 100K a year. Peaking 
												at 10,595 purchases in store for the 60K-80K bracket and bottoming out at 138 for the 100K-120K bracket. But there were
												 fewer people in the higher salary bracket and I wanted to see how that affected the average purchase price. That being
												  said, there is an average purchase of $74.00 for the 60k-80k bracket then drops to $35.54. A 52% drop in purchasing amount. 
											<p>	
												  But what could this mean? People that hit a level of income that they no longer use Ifood as regularly as before? That 
												they are able to spend the time and the money going out to eat and indulging? 
											</p>
											<p>	
												Lastly, I was intrigued by the spending habits of the customers. What customers wanted to elevate their purchase by buying an
												 extravagant brand or item? How did their income affect this spending, I was very surprised by the result!
											</p>	 
											</p>
										</section>	
										<p>
											</p>
											
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Gold Percentage Income.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												The data shows us that the lower the annual income of an individual, the higher the percentage of their money goes to the purchase of 
												gold-labeled products. There is only a 29% relation between income and the percentage of that income being spent on top-tier products. 
												This chart does not look into the average amount spent or the number of purchases that the people make. 
											</p>	 
											</p>
										</section>
										<p>
											</p>
											
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Income Brackets.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												By making a pivot chart back in Excel we can see that the highest number of purchases by an income bracket was that of the 60k-80K group
												 but the highest average number of gold purchases was seen in the 100k-120k group. We see that actually the more you make the less you 
												 spend on gold-labeled products relative to your income. Inversely we see that the higher income individuals buy more gold-labeled products,
												  it just isn't a higher percentage of their income.

												<h3>Takeout Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Overall Ifood is doing something right having over $1.24 million in sales, and attracting over 2000 customers to use its services. This data 
												has really shown the importance a business model like this can have on an income bracket. I would have never thought that the lower someone's
												 income the more that they would spend on high-tiered products, I initially thought the opposite. This was an informative project and one I enjoyed.
												  Being able to use Excel, SQL, and Tableau on a project, changes how you can see the data as a whole. 
											</p>
											<p>
												I am working on improving my data skills. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to message me. Additionally, I am seeking 
												opportunities to utilize my data analytics skills in my career, so if you know of any opportunities, I would be open to exploring them.
											</p>

												Feel free to contact or connect with me on LinkedIn and be on the lookout for more data-driven projects!

											<h2>The Learning Curve:</h2>
											<p>Mapping the Performance of Massachusetts Schools</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Raising children is the hardest thing, in my opinion, a person can do, you have to make choice for the children that
											 will affect them for the rest of their lives. That's why the topic of schooling is such a sensitive subject. Homeschooling
											  vs traditional schooling has been a topic of discussion as of late and I wanted to gain some insight as to how successful
											   the Massachusetts school did in preparing their students for college. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Would you care to guess if there is an impact on whether class size affects college admissions or what the worst district in
											 Massachusetts is for graduation rate? These are the types of questions I asked to form a basis for my analysis.  
										</p>
										<p>
											The data comes from the Massachusetts Department of Education Website for 2017. So the data is not current but still gives
											 a good insight as to how the state is doing with educating the youth. The data comes from multiple tables and all are combined
											  in this Kaggle Dataset. 
										</p>
										<p>
											<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008">Massachusetts Public Schools Data</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											Here's a sneak peek into some things I found: 
										</p>
										<p>
											<li>There is a positive relationship between greater class sizes and greater college admissions rates</li>
											<li>Roughly 950,000 students attend the 1,800 schools in the state that was in this study</li>
											<li>Springfield country holds 3 of the top 10 worst-performing schools in the state</li>
										</p>
										
										<p>
										<section>
											
										<p>
											The Massachusetts Department of Education Website holds all the information I needed to answer my questions.
											 But what were my questions:

											<li>What schools are struggling the most?</li>
											<li>What are the top math schools in the state?</li>
											<li>How does class size affect college admission?</li>
										</p>
										<p>	Now let's start with the big numbers. In the data presented, there were 1,800 schools housing 953,748 students.

											<h3>Worst of the Worst</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The next step was to look into the schools that are struggling, and I interpreted that by looking at the graduation
											 rate. So in Tableau, I looked to display the 10 worst schools for graduation rate. We see Springfield Public Day High
											  School with the lowest graduation rate, 8.7% of the students graduating from the school, as well as Boston Day and 
											  Evening Academy Charter School at 9.8%. 
										</p>
										</section>
										<p>
										</p>
										<p>
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Mass Schools/WorstSchools.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												We need to look closer into some attributes of the student body to see if there might be something that correlates 
												with the low graduation rate. We see that the lowest school Springfield Public Day High School, is comprised 100% of
												 students with disabilities. Where as the second worst school, Boston Day and Evening Academy Charter School, only 27%
												  of the students have disabilities. So there is a discrepancy here that needs to be taken into account when looking 
												  at this chart. 
											</p>
											<p>In the chart above, there are schools in pink as well as turquoise. The chart is matched with the chart below showing 
												the 10 worst districts in the state. So we see that 3 of the 10 worst schools are in the Springfield district, which is
												 attributed to the district's low 50% graduation rate. Contrast Springfield district's 58 schools, with the worst district,
												  Boston Day and Evening Academy Charter, with only one school under the same name. Additionally, 5 of the 10 schools in 
												  this list only have one school for the district they are in.

												There is an additional map that shows the geographical correlation between the worst schools/ districts on my Tableau account,
												 that you can check out <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dillon.sandberg/viz/Mass_Worst_School_Dashboard/Story1">here</a>.

												<h3>Best of the Best</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I was also curious as to look at the schools that excelled in teaching their students, so I charted out the schools with
												 the highest percentage of students that were Proficient and Advanced in Math for the 4th Grade level. The top of the chart
												  shows the highest percentage(blue) and the bottom the lowest (orange). We see the top two schools are Heath and East 
												  Elementary at 95%, and the bottom 2 are Henry Lord Community School and Athol Community Elementary at 14%. There are 183
												   schools at or above the 50% line with 71 schools under it. I want to say as well, that I am looking at students with 
												   Proficient and Advanced levels of knowledge, so some of the schools on the lower end of this chart may still have a high 
												   percentage of students with passable knowledge of 4th grade Math.

											</p>
											<p>
												*This is an interactive chart displaying all schools. To view this chart at its best, view it on Tableau <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dillon.sandberg/viz/Mass_Worst_School_Dashboard/Story1">here</a>.
											</p>
											<p>
												Looking at best of best we need to see what schools excel at converting their graduates into college academics. Here is a
												 density chart sectioned off to differentiate the schools: LH(Low Graduated/High College Admissions), LL(Low Graduated/Low 
												 College Admissions), HH(High Graduated/High College Admissions), and HL(High Graduated/ Low College Admissions). There is a 
												 higher concentration of schools that I would say succeed in converting their graduates into college academics(HH group), so 
												 let's look at the other three groups.
											</p>
											
										</section>
											
											
										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Mass Schools/Graduation:Admissions.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												In the LH group, we see there are three schools that do a great job at getting graduates to go to college, unfortunately, there
												 are just so few of them. Makes you wonder why the graduation rate is so low? Other the other end the HL group is quite 
												 interesting. What can we learn about the schools with high graduation rates but low college admissions? We see that a large 
												 group of them are vocational schools or trade schools. Schools designed to get the students ready for the workforce instead of 
												 college so it makes sense why they would be in this grouping. 

											</p>
											<p>	
												Lastly, I wanted to get an idea if class size affected college admissions. But I also wanted to see of all the schools which were
												the ones with the highest percentage of students that were disadvantaged. So below we see a positive correlation between class size
												 and college admissions. So the higher the class size the higher the percentage of attending college. With a concentration of schools
												  that have a class size between 14 and 18 students. The interesting thing is when we look at the students that are disadvantaged. 
											</p>

										<section>
											<p>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Mass Schools/ClassSize:Admissions.png" alt="" /></a>
											</p>
											<p>
												The higher the percentage of the student body that are disadvantaged, the lower the percentage the student body attends college as 
												well. This can mean a couple of things, there might be some resource gaps in these schools with fewer college counselors or, advanced
												 placement programs, and there could be a lower academic performance from the disadvantaged students making it harder to get into college
												  in the first place, or there might just be a limiting awareness of college opportunities.

												<h3>Bell has Rung...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In the end, we see that there are a ton of different aspects of the education system that affect the schools in Massachusetts. But let's
												 look at what we've learned:
											</p>
											<p>
												<li>The higher the class size the higher percentage of attending college</li>
												<li>The higher the school graduating percentage, the higher the percentage attending college</li>
												<li>Springfield district is the worst academic in the school having 3 of the 10 worst performing schools in the state</li>
											</p>
											<p>This has been a very insightful look into the education system. And being able to use Excel and Tableau to create a data story has me excited
												 to get into more projects. 
											</p>

											<p>
												I am working on improving my data skills. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to message me. Additionally, I am seeking 
												opportunities to utilize my data analytics skills in my career, so if you know of any opportunities, I would be open to exploring them.
